        ATMs dispensing music?   I dont quite see the logic in that.  Im not entirely against paying a nominal fee for music, or any other media, but if I do have to pay for it Id be much more likely to buy stuff from my own PC.

        The Register reports on war driving   the wireless equivalent of war dialing.  Instead of having your modem dial into thousands of networks until you get in, you just drive within range of a wireless net with your wirelessequipped laptop and hack away.    related:    The latest issue of CIO  has a great feature on wireless.

        Rumour has it  that the parent companies of   Inside.com  and   Brills Content  will be announcing a merger as early as next Monday.  Apparently the two print magazines would fold into one called  Brills Inside Content  and the two websites would form  Media Central Inside.com .  Rolls right off the tongue, doesnt it?

      I just spent some time playing with the beta version of   Atmosphere , Adobes new 3D environment software, and thought Id give a couple of quick impressions.    Ive always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community.  You could build all these really cool places but people couldnt interact in them.  You also couldnt easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages.  I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML anybody remember Terra Vista? but it didnt as far as we would have liked.  Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems.  Its not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.

        Home of the Underdogs  is an amazing resource for anyone that loves computer games.  Not only do they have hundreds of games you can download which are no longer available from the companies, they also have a wealth of information about many of the games.  Its not entirely legal, but I think its a great public service.  Its even better now that they have one of my favorite games,   Gabriel Knight .
